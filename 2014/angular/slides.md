Angular
=======


ngApp - defines the root scope.
ngController - defines a portion of html bound to this controller.


MVC components in angular
-------------------------

* Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties are accessed through bindings.
* View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.
* Controller — The ngController directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values
